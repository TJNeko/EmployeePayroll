## Usage

To use this site you will first want to click the big blue button in the center that reads add employee in white text. Once this button has been clicked you will be prompted with a window that aks you to enter the employees first name. You should probably do that otherwise you should not have clicked the add employee button. After you enter the first name click ok. Then you will be prompted to enter the employees last name, you should do that as well, if your employee does not have a last name then they are not real, DO NOT add them as an employee. After you enter the last name click ok again. Then you will finally be prompted to enter your employees salary, i reccomend not paying your employees but the government kind of says you have to so enter the salary and hit ok. Now you will have the option to add another employee, hit ok if you would like to and run through the steps again, or you can hit cancel, after you hit cancel you will see your employees and their salary in the middle of the screen in black text. now just for fun you can open the console. when the console is open you will see a random employee has been chosen, you can use this to give a random employee a bonus or if you need to fire a random employee. Have fun.
